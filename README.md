<h1 align="center">Sandbox Plugin</h1>
</p>

<p align="center">A base plugin for testing, debugging, or just playing around in the sand.</p>

Sometimes, you don't need or want a full fledged plugin to test out a simple feature
or to recreate a bug. Maybe you want to try out a new idea within a plugin, or see
how a plugin behaves in a certain use case. If so, you are in the right place.

The sandbox plugin is a simple plugin, or a template of one, that can be used, modified,
or extended for your own use. In particular this is useful for re-creating use cases or
bugs where it might not be as easy to do with a plugin hooked up to live hardware.

See the [SDK documentation](https://synse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdk/intro/) for more details
on plugins and the Synse platform.

## Using

This repo defines a valid plugin with devices, but it is bare-bones. If you wish to use it,
fork it and update it to your needs.
